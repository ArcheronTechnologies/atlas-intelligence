## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Create Railway Project

```bash
# Install Railway CLI (if not installed)
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Initialize project
railway init
```

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

**Required Variables:**
```env
# Database (add PostgreSQL addon first)
DATABASE_URL=<auto-provided-by-railway>

# Redis (add Redis addon - optional)
REDIS_URL=<auto-provided-by-railway>

# Atlas Configuration
ATLAS_ENV=production
ATLAS_API_VERSION=v1
LOG_LEVEL=INFO

# Feature Flags
PROMETHEUS_ENABLED=true
```

**Optional Variables:**
```env
# API Configuration
MAX_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SEC=30
RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=100
MODEL_CACHE_SIZE_MB=500

# CORS (if custom domain)
CORS_ORIGINS=https://halo.yourdomain.com,https://frontline.yourdomain.com
```

### Step 3: Add PostgreSQL Database

```bash
# Add PostgreSQL addon
railway add postgresql

# Railway will automatically set DATABASE_URL
```

### Step 4: Deploy

```bash
# Deploy to Railway
railway up

# Or connect to GitHub for automatic deployments
railway connect  # Links to GitHub repo
```

### Step 5: Run Database Migrations

```bash
# After first deployment, run migrations
railway run alembic upgrade head
```

### Step 6: Verify Deployment

```bash
# Get deployment URL
railway domain

# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health

# Test API
curl https://your-app.railway.app/
```

## üìä Expected Build Time

| Phase | Duration | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Dependency Installation** | 5-8 minutes | PyTorch, ultralytics, librosa are large |
| **Build** | 1-2 minutes | Compiling Python packages |
| **Deploy** | 30-60 seconds | Container start |
| **Total** | **7-11 minutes** | First deployment |

**Subsequent deployments:** 2-3 minutes (cached dependencies)

---

## üîß Railway Configuration

### `railway.toml`

```toml
[build]
builder = "NIXPACKS"
buildCommand = "pip install -r requirements.txt"

[deploy]
startCommand = "daphne -b 0.0.0.0 -p $PORT main:app"
healthcheckPath = "/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 100
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 10

[env]
ATLAS_ENV = "production"
LOG_LEVEL = "INFO"
PROMETHEUS_ENABLED = "true"
```

### `Procfile`

```
web: daphne -b 0.0.0.0 -p $PORT main:app
```

## üí∞ Estimated Costs

### Starter Plan ($5/month)
- **Compute:** Included
- **PostgreSQL:** $5/month
- **Redis:** Free tier (sufficient)
- **Bandwidth:** 100GB included

**Total: ~$10/month** (with database)

### Recommended for Production: Hobby Plan ($20/month)
- **Compute:** Better performance
- **PostgreSQL:** Larger database
- **Redis:** More capacity
- **Bandwidth:** 500GB

**Total: ~$30-40/month**

---

## üö® Common Deployment Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: Build Timeout

**Symptom:** Build fails after 10+ minutes

**Fix:**
```bash
# In Railway dashboard, increase build timeout:
Settings ‚Üí Deployment ‚Üí Build Timeout ‚Üí 15 minutes
```

### Issue 2: Memory Limit Exceeded

**Symptom:** Container crashes with OOM error

**Fix:**
```bash
# Increase memory limit in Railway dashboard
Settings ‚Üí Resources ‚Üí Memory ‚Üí 1GB (minimum)
```

### Issue 3: Database Connection Failed

**Symptom:** Health check returns database unavailable

**Fix:**
1. Verify PostgreSQL addon is added
2. Check `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for database to be ready

### Issue 4: Port Binding Error

**Symptom:** App doesn't respond to requests

**Fix:**
- Ensure using `$PORT` environment variable (Railway auto-assigns)
- Check Procfile uses correct port binding: `-p $PORT`

### Issue 5: Model Loading Timeout

**Symptom:** YOLOv8 model download fails

**Fix:**
```python
# models/ directory should be committed to git
# Ensure yolov8n.pt is in repository (6.2MB)
git add models/yolov8n.pt
git commit -m "Add YOLOv8 model"
```

## üîç Post-Deployment Validation

### 1. Health Check
```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "database": "healthy",  # or "unavailable" initially
  "mode": "full",
  "services": {
    "threat_classifier": "operational",
    "visual_detector": "operational",
    "audio_classifier": "operational"
  },
  "version": "0.1.0"
}
```

### 2. API Root
```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/

# Expected response:
{
  "service": "Atlas Intelligence",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "environment": "production",
  "status": "operational"
}
```

### 3. Threat Classification
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/api/v1/classify/threat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "text", "data": "Someone is shooting"}'

# Expected: classification with category="weapons"
```

### 4. API Documentation
```
https://your-app.railway.app/docs
```

### 5. Metrics (if enabled)

| **API Response** | < 200ms | `curl -w "@time.txt"` |
| **Memory Usage** | < 512MB | Railway dashboard |
| **Uptime** | > 99.5% | Railway metrics |
